# Lab 2: Blinky-Buzzy Toy

For your second project, your task is to use the MSP430 Microcontroller and your creativity to design a toy. Each MSP430 board is equipped with buttons, LED's, a speaker, and an LED screen. Utilizing these features and your knowledge of I/O, develop a program to turn the board into a toy.

This toy should at minimum:

* generate sounds,
* dynamically change the LEDs that are illuminated, both brighly and dimmly,
* implement a state machine to maintain the state of the toy,
* and use the four buttons on the expansion board (P2.0-3) to transition the state machine.

**Furthermore, at least one of the functions to transition the state machine must be written by you in assembly language.**

## Getting Started 

Inside this repository you will find two directories:
1. The 'demos' directory contains sample programs for you to review and learn from. These example programs are a great starting point in understanding how to program the MSP430 microcontroller.
2. The 'project' directory should contain the source code for your toy.
